        <h1 class="Swiss"><strong>Swiss Watches and Collections</strong></h1>
        <p class="Swiss_des">Our clients come to us because the watch they wear on their wrist matters to them – just as it matters to us. They tell us no one knows the market like we do and that they would never look anywhere else for the latest collections and the best service. Because of that, some of our clients have been with us for over 50 years – we like to think of them as ‘friends of the business’.

            There are 7 Watches of Switzerland showrooms in the United States, in addition to dedicated Rolex, Breitling and Omega boutiques.
            
            At each you’ll find the same warm welcome and personal approach, where no question is too hard and no request too much.
            
            Although we can’t offer you a glass of champagne here on our website, we hope you feel especially welcome and enjoy browsing our collections. If there’s anything we can do to help you as you search for your perfect timepiece, please don’t hesitate to contact us. If you’d like to arrange a viewing to come and try on a watch before you purchase, we’ll be happy to welcome you into one of our stores. We’re here to help.</p>
